                                 <center><p class="para_1">Buses are one of the most widely used modes of public transportation in the world. They play a 
                                    crucial role in connecting cities, towns, and villages, making travel accessible and affordable for everyone. From daily 
                                    commuters heading to work or school to travelers embarking on long-distance journeys, buses provide a reliable solution
                                     for millions of people every day. Over the years, buses have evolved from simple vehicles to modern, feature-rich transport
                                      systems designed for comfort, safety, and efficiency.There are various types of buses available today, each catering to 
                                      different needs. City buses, for example, operate on fixed routes within urban areas, making frequent stops to pick up 
                                      and drop off passengers. These are essential for reducing traffic congestion and promoting eco-friendly travel. Intercity 
                                      buses connect distant cities and are ideal for longer trips. They often include features like reclining seats, air conditioning,
                                       onboard entertainment, and rest stops.<br>
                                     Tourist buses are designed specifically for sightseeing and travel purposes. These buses often have panoramic windows, guided 
                                     commentary, and amenities  that enhance the travel experience. School buses are a dedicated fleet used to safely transport children
                                      to and from school. Shuttle buses, on the
                                       other hand, serve airports, hotels, and corporate campuses, providing short-distance transport.
                                     Buses also differ in terms of size and seating capacity. Mini-buses are smaller and can accommodate fewer passengers, while 
                                     full-sized coaches are built for large groups. Double-decker buses, which are popular in cities like London, offer more seating 
                                     space and a unique travel experience.</p>
